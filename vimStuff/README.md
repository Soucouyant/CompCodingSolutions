## Read me first!

As with any vimrc found online, it is tailored to how the creator likes to codeand use vim.

I implore you to read through the .text file and understand each line and what it does.

When I was making this vimrc, I did the same thing. I used other people's vimrc's and researched what each line did, figuring out if it was right for me or not.

**Also note**

I only use vimrc for coding competitions, in which I exclusively write in c++. If you take a look at the autocmd tags near the bottom, you will see that the only compile and run bind I have is for gcc.

Oh, and you need Vundle (Plugin Manager for Vim), there's many detailed guides online to install and use Vundle so no need to fear.

Other than that, have fun!
